## Environment Setup
This document will walk you through the steps for setting up the environment for your Raspberry Pi. The prequists for this page include downloading [VNC Viewer](https://www.realvnc.com/en/connect/download/viewer/raspberrypi/?lai_sr=0-4&lai_sl=l)
and a IP scanner (the recommended one can be found [here](https://angryip.org/)). Download both before continuing. 

Note: This tutorial provides a basic setup using a pre-configured network (<b>RoboBulls_Network_ENG202B</b>).

### Connecting with VNC
Connect to the RoboBulls_Network_ENG202B with your laptop.

Turn on the MicroROS Robot Pi5. It will be ready to connect when your hear a beep.

Use the IP Scanner to scan for the Pi5. Once found, this will be the IP used to connect to the Pi5. (???)

Type the IP address into the top bar of the VNC viewer. Enter the username: <b>Root</b> and password: <b>12345678</b> (???)
