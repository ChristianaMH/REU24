## Environment Setup
This document will walk you through the steps for setting up the environment for your Raspberry Pi. The prequists for this page include downloading [VNC Viewer](https://www.realvnc.com/en/connect/download/viewer/raspberrypi/?lai_sr=0-4&lai_sl=l)
and a IP scanner (the recommended one can be found [here](https://angryip.org/)). Download both before continuing. 

Note: This tutorial provides a basic setup using a pre-configured network (<b>RoboBulls_Network_ENG202B</b>).
