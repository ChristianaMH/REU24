### Software Applications for Download
#### [VNC Viewer](https://www.realvnc.com/en/connect/download/viewer/raspberrypi/?lai_sr=5-9&lai_sl=l)
A VNC (Virtual Network Computing) viewer is used to remotely access and control a Raspberry Pi's graphical desktop environment from another computer. This allows users to interact with the Raspberry Pi as if they were physically connected to it, using the keyboard and mouse of the remote device. VNC is particularly useful for managing headless Raspberry Pi setups (those without a monitor, keyboard, or mouse attached) and for performing tasks remotely over a network.
#### [Angry IP Scanner](https://angryip.org/) (Optional for Setup)
Network scanner for finding raspberry pi IP address once connected to the network.
